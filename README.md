# Hello There!
You can call me Aure, I am a B.Sc. student in Physics at the University of Catania, Sicily, Italy.
> [!WARNING]
> This `.md` file is still under construction. Thanks for your patience.

I mainly use C and $\LaTeX$, so this is what you are probably going to find around here.

What am I up to?
- Currently working on University projects, mainly physics simulations, reports and notes;
- I'm also trying to learn Haskell;
- Not a developer though!

Euler-Lagrange Equations:

$$\frac{\text{d}}{\text{d}t}\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial{\dot{q}}^\alpha}-\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial q^\alpha}=0;$$

Hamilton's Equations:

$$\dot{q}^\alpha = \frac{\partial\mathcal{H}}{\partial p_\alpha},\qquad\dot{p}_\alpha = -\frac{\partial\mathcal{H}}{\partial q^\alpha}.$$

Here is a little picture of Planetary Nebula M20 I took:
